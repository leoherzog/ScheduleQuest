## What is this?

 ScheduleQuest is a free, open-source web app to distribute to your recipients for scheduling with your Google Calendar, built on Google Apps Script. The Calendlys/cal.coms/YouCanBook.Mes of the world charge for the features you need, and [Google Calendar's built-in Appointment Scheduling](https://www.wired.com/story/calendly-google-calendar-appointment-schedule/) is a bit limited in customizability.

## Setup

Making your own ScheduleQuest page is easy!

1. Create a new [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) project as the user that you want to be invited to newly created events. Give this script a name in the top left (e.g. ScheduleQuest).
2. Click `Services ‚ûï` in the left sidebar, scroll down to and select `Google Calendar API`, and click `Add`.
3. Copy and paste the three files from [the `src` folder](https://github.com/leoherzog/ScheduleQuest/blob/main/src/) in this repository into three files in your Apps Script project named `Code.gs`, `index.html`, `config.html`.
4. Customize the `config.html` file to contain the types of meetings you want to offer. Details are available in [the configuration section below](#configuration).
5. Click `Deploy ‚è∑` in the top right, then `New Deployment`. Change the `Who Has Access` dropdown to whomever you want to be able to access your scheduling page, then click `Deploy`.

Apps Script will then show you a deployment "Web App" URL that you can copy to the clipboard. This is the link to distribute to your recipients!

### Configuration

<script>
  const meetingTypes = {

     "demo": { // a short unique id used internally for the type of meeting

      "scheduleOn": "primary",

      // array of calendar ids to check against for availability
      "busyAgainst": ["primary", "myotheraccount@gmail.com", "example.com_saj4co1nm5kyh8qs440fssktx4@group.calendar.google.com"],

</script>
```

#### Advanced

ScheduleQuest is built with the excellent [PicoCSS](https://picocss.org/) framework. It encourages simple and symantic HTML. If you'd like to customize the look and feel of your page, edit the `index.html` file in your Apps Script project with your own classes or style overrides.

Example:

```html
<style>
  :root[data-theme="light"], :root[data-theme="dark"] {
    --primary: #DB4437; /* google red */
    --primary-hover: #BD2E22; /* 10% darker */
    --primary-focus: #BD2E22; 
  }
</style>
```
